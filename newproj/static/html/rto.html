The RTO of Vellore functions as per the guidelines of the Motor Vehicles Act to provide transport-related services.  
The city is known for its leather and tannery industry, and it is also called the leather hub of India for the same reason.
The resultant industrial development has resulted in a significant increase in new vehicle registrations.
The more the vehicle registrations, the more vehicles on the road. Despite a rapid spike in the service requests,
the Vellore Regional Transport offiuce provides efficient vehicle and driver-related services in the city.
